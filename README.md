# Box Overview

supergreenBox is a grow box designed to maximize g/w using a vertical scrog technique. In order to facilitate the plant care, the box has 4 doors maintained in place using magnets. The box is built on wheels, has 2 inlets for standrd 80mm fans, an outlet for standard 120mm blower and mounts for leds and scrog.

The box is built using standard 6mm and 3mm MDF cut using a laser cutter, some 3D printed parts (about 1h print/box), and various parts easily orderable on amazon, aliexpress ect.. The assembly is made using mostly M4 threaded metal screws and nuts.

An assembly manual will soon be available.
